<ol>
  <li>Product finalises a release; tags tickets with the release number in Jira; plans Sprint, and development starts for that specific release version.</li>
  <li>Freezing of Release Candidate for QA to test and Sign-off for production release</li>
</ol>

<p>Once deployed to Pre-Prod, and QA starts testing, we cannot push any new changes to any services; except the bug fixes that have to go in this release.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Developers should get an environment to test their development independently. It should be possible if a front-end engineer wants to try their feature integration with a back-end service while it is live or in development.
    <ol>
      <li>Developers can use live (pre-prod) services via the link for almost all applications and point to in-development services from test deployments ensuring non-redundant deployments. Developers will have to deploy the changed services for testing manually. Manual configuration of changes is a fair practice as developers are clear about what all services needs modifications compared to the current production setup.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

<ul>
  <li>The configurations can be done at the service mesh level. Engineers will only have to configure the appropriate services mesh config to bring a working system up in local / deployed Kubernetes cluster; with relevant services only enabled.</li>

<p>In a microservice architecture, you typically find:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Teams are organized around business capabilities such as cross-functional teams of several UI, middleware, and back-end developers, a database administrator, and a DevOps specialist.</li>
  <li>Decentralized governance that allows every team to choose the right tool for their job.</li>
  <li>Decentralized data management that allows each microservice or group of related microservices to manage its own data.</li>
  <li>Testing, deployment, and infrastructure typically are automated with little or no manual intervention.</li>
</ul>
