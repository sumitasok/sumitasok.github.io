<h2 id="references-between-client-and-service">References between client and service</h2>

<p>Here, the client is the caller, and the service is the recipient who also provides a unique functionality over this API.</p>

<p>We will use order and payments as an example where order-service will use payment-service to manage payments.</p>

<h3 id="functional-requirements">Functional requirements:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>An order service can attempt payment via payment service. Payment-service encapsulates nuances associated with the payment and finally return the status of payment.</li>
  <li>The Order-service should re-request the payment service for managing the userâ€™s payment when the previous payment method fails.</li>
  <li>The order should be able to fetch the successful Payment from Payment-service.</li>
  <li>The order should be able to fetch all the payment attempts from the Payment-service, including the failed.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="architecture">Architecture:</h3>

<p>In this scenario, Payment-service should store the payment-related information. It should be able to return Payment-data filtered on the order that it tried to service.</p>

<p>The aforementioned is a classic example of a Service needing reference to its caller.</p>

<p>The client must send some unique identifiers to the service to identify the client request later.</p>

<p>E.g, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tenant-identifier:string</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">request-type:string</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">request-identifier:string</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tenant-identifier: is used to identify the client in a multi-tenant environment. (there is an authorisation step additionally using data encryption-decryption pattern)</li>
  <li>Request-type: is used to identify the requester within the tenant. It gives the requester flexibility to register multiple callers under a single tenant instead of creating and managing numerous tenants.</li>
  <li>Request-identifier: request identifier is a string as the client is open to choose his version of ID, be it integer or UUID. The requestor should convert their ID into a string and post it to the service.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Service should generate and return</p>

<ul>
  <li>service-ID: an identifier unique across the deployment of the service.</li>
</ul>

<p>After furnishing the service request, the service should return a unique identifier to the caller.</p>

<p>The caller can request this specific service information by calling the service with the client-request-id and service-id.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET /&lt;service&gt;/&lt;tenantID&gt;/&lt;service-resource&gt;/&lt;client-request-type&gt;/&lt;client-request-id&gt;/&lt;service-id&gt;</code></p>

<h3 id="entity-relationships">Entity Relationships</h3>

<p><img src="images/image1.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>

<p>The service should not restrict the caller to be having a has_one relationship with their service. It is entirely up to the client to define how the relationship should be.</p>

<p>The client should be able to get all the Payments associated with the order using the below URL</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET /&lt;service&gt;/&lt;tenantID&gt;/&lt;service-resource&gt;/&lt;client-request-type&gt;/&lt;client-request-id&gt;</code></p>

<p>At the client end,</p>

<p>It has to cache all the payment IDs, and in case they have a one to one relationship, maintain the latest service-id against the order.</p>

<p>Reciprocate this functionality at the Service level by implementing the below URL.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET /&lt;service&gt;/&lt;tenantID&gt;/&lt;service-resource&gt;/&lt;client-request-type&gt;/&lt;client-request-id&gt;/?**latest=true**</code></p>

<p>So that the client can always access which is the active service data for a resource (order)</p>
