# Pre-Production deployment strategies

1. Product finalises a release; tags tickets with the release number in Jira; plans Sprint, and development starts for that specific release version.
2. Freezing of Release Candidate for QA to test and Sign-off for production release

Once deployed to Pre-Prod, and QA starts testing, we cannot push any new changes to any services; except the bug fixes that have to go in this release.

3. Developers should get an environment to test their development independently. It should be possible if a front-end engineer wants to try their feature integration with a back-end service while it is live or in development.
   1. Developers can use live (pre-prod) services via the link for almost all applications and point to in-development services from test deployments ensuring non-redundant deployments. Developers will have to deploy the changed services for testing manually. Manual configuration of changes is a fair practice as developers are clear about what all services needs modifications compared to the current production setup.

    participant alreadyDevelopedBackendYService as In-Preprod<br>Backend comment-Service <br> preprod.example.com/api/comments

    inDevBackendService ->> inDevBackendXService: talk to a service deployed alongside
    inDevBackendService ->> alreadyDevelopedBackendYService: talk to a service deployed in pre-prod
    alreadyDevelopedBackendYService -->> inDevBackendService: this request will require In-Prod system to be deployed locally.<br> becomes a dependancy.

```

- The configurations can be done at the service mesh level. Engineers will only have to configure the appropriate services mesh config to bring a working system up in local / deployed Kubernetes cluster; with relevant services only enabled.
